   <h1>Here are some of the frequently asked questions about Exercising and Recovery.</h1>

   <h3> Q: How many calories should I be eating per day?</h3>

   <P>A: Everyone has a different need for calories, depending on your current weight, fitness goals, activity level, and body type. You can use tools like If it fits your macros at: <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.iifym.com">If It Fits Your Macros</a> to get your daily macros based on your activity level and weight loss/gain goals.</P>

  <h3>Q: How much cardio should I be doing per day/week?</h3>

  <p> A: To see the best results, it is recommended to do at least 30 mins of cardio 5 days a week.There many types of cardio like, the star stepper, rower, treadmill walking or running, and HIIT (High intensity interval training) cardio.</p> 
  <h3>Q: What type of weight training did you do to reach your goals?</h3>
  <p>A: I weight trained five days a week and worked on specific muscle groups each day. For example, on Mondayâ€™s I would train glutes and quads. So, I would do up to five strength training exercises such as squats, leg extensions, leg press, deadlifts, and hip thrusts. Depending on your fitness level, You can start at a lower range and use lower weights until you feel comfortable to move up.</p>
   
  <h3> What do you do for recovery and how many rest days do you recommend?</h3>
  <p>A: Recovery is very important in your weight loss journey. When you change your routine and start a new diet and exercise program your body may start to feel sore and you may have some inflammation especially if you are weight training so having rest days is very much needed. If you are new to exercising, I would say having 2-3 rest days. On your rest days you may do some light exercise like yoga, stretching, and a walk. I would recommend also incorporating Epsom salt baths and foam rolling.</p> 
  <h3>Q: What is Foam Rolling?</h3>
  <p> A: Foam rolling is the use of an exercise foam roller to stretch and massage different muscle groups. Here is a video that explains how to use a Foam Roller: <a class="links" href="https://youtu.be/Lk13KFV0OUA">Foam Rolling Example</a></p>
